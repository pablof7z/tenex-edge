//! Transport-agnostic session hosting seam.
//!
//! A "hosted session" is opened over exactly one transport. The portable PTY is
//! driven DIRECTLY (`pty::spawn_session` / `pty::inject`, argv shaped by the
//! `registry` sniffers) and reaches [`PtyTransport`] only for `kind`/`kill`.
//! `AcpTransport` is the JSON-RPC backend (ACP / codex app-server) for harnesses
//! that expose an `RpcTurn` model, and is the sole full [`SessionTransport`] impl
//! — its `launch`/`resume`/`deliver`/`is_live` are the ones actually invoked.
//!
//! Object dispatch is via the [`TransportImpl`] enum rather than `dyn` (native
//! async-fn-in-trait is not object-safe and we avoid pulling `async-trait`).
//! The [`SessionTransport`] trait documents the RPC contract `AcpTransport`
//! fulfils.
