//! Transport — a thin adapter over `nostr-sdk` (M1 §2).
//!
//! Speaks wire events only: connect to relays (with NIP-42 auto-AUTH), publish
//! signed events, subscribe with filters, one-shot fetch for resolution. It
//! knows nothing of domain meaning — the codec owns that.
//!
//! (M1 names NMP as the eventual transport. NMP turned out to be a full
//! cross-platform app *kernel*, a poor fit for a headless CLI; the wire output
//! is identical standard Nostr either way, and this whole layer sits behind the
//! codec seam, so an NMP-backed transport remains a drop-in replacement.)
