//! Prompt rendering for fabric message injection.
//!
//! Two terminal-injection envelope forms, chosen by `(sender, directedness)`:
//!
//!   1. **human mention** — submitted as a real turn with minimal provenance:
//!      `<@pablo> @developer hey there`.
//!   2. **agent mention** — submitted as a turn, framed so the agent knows it
//!      arrived via the fabric: `[tenex-edge mention] <@agent1> hi @developer`.
//!
//! Publishing no longer happens automatically on the agent's behalf — the
//! envelope carries an explicit reminder to respond via `tenex-edge channel
//! send`, since nothing mirrors the reply for it.
//!
//! Hook-delivered mentions and ambient channel activity are rendered by the
//! unified fabric context view, not by this envelope module.
//!
//! Echo suppression no longer lives in this text; direct delivery records the
//! pasted inbox event ids as explicit `injected` ledger rows. Envelopes are free
//! to be bare. Message ids are intentionally absent: replies target `@name`.
