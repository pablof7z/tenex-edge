//! Reattachable session hosting for tenex-edge.
//!
//! Two public surfaces:
//!
//!   • `ring_doorbells(state)` — called after chat delivery events.
//!     Finds sessions that have unread chat mentions + a live PTY endpoint, then
//!     injects the rendered pending messages into the agent.
//!
//!   • `spawn_agent(state, slug, project, launch_args)` — spawns a new
//!     PTY-hosted harness. Manual spawns start clean; no prompt is injected.
//!
//! Delivery is fail-open: endpoint failures are logged and pending inbox rows are
//! returned to the queue so another path can deliver them.
