/// `backend_pubkey` is this daemon's signing pubkey, used to decide whether we

/// clears `turn_started_at`, while `seen_cursor` is the durable awareness cursor.
/// Text-only shim preserving the historical `Option<String>` contract for the
/// hook-parity tests; the daemon calls [`assemble_turn_start`] for the receipt.
