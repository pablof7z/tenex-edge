//! Auto-publish an agent's final response when a pty-injected turn ends without
//! an explicit `channel send`.
//!
//! A hosted agent receives a kind:9 mention typed into its PTY, runs its turn,
//! and is expected to reply by invoking `tenex-edge channel send`. Some agents
//! finish the turn by printing a final answer to their own transcript and stop,
//! publishing nothing — so from the channel's perspective they never responded.
//!
//! This module closes that gap:
//!   1. [`arm`] records the un-answered mention when it is injected into the PTY
//!      (channel, triggering event id, and requester pubkey).
//!   2. [`note_explicit_publish`] cancels it the moment the agent publishes
//!      itself and blocks future arming for that live daemon process.
//!   3. On turn end, [`take`] returns any still-pending entry and
//!      [`publish_last_response`] posts the transcript's last assistant text as
//!      the reply, threaded to the triggering event via an `e` tag and
//!      addressed back to the requester via a `p` tag.
//!
//! State is process-global and in-memory (mirroring the delivery debounce): the
//! daemon is a single process, and a restart at worst drops one pending
//! auto-reply — far simpler than a durable schema for ephemeral turn state.
