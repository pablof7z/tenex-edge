//! Daemon integration: state-mutating RPCs end-to-end, multi-agent mention
//! routing, and the ~16-concurrent-writer corruption repro through the RPC path.
//!
//! All tests run against a real spawned `daemon` (one relay → a local
//! `nak serve`, never the production fabric) over a UDS in an isolated
//! `MOSAICO_HOME`. Env mutation is serialized; the file is run single-threaded
//! by the runner invocation in the SUMMARY (each test sets process-global env).
