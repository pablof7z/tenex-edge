# Third-Party Chatbots Through MCP

Read this reference only when the user asks to connect ChatGPT, Grok, or another
MCP client to Mosaico.

## Know The Current Boundary

`mosaico mcp` exposes Mosaico resources and channel tools to MCP clients. The
agent skill is also packaged for clients that cannot load a local skill install:
read-only resource `mosaico://skill` (and `mosaico://skill/{name}`), plus the
`mosaico.skill` tool (prefer the tool when the client does not support resources).
MCP clients can block without polling through `mosaico.wait`, or set
`wait_seconds` on `mosaico.channel_send` to await a reply correlated to the sent
message.
Remote HTTP calls do not borrow the server process's caller context:

- ChatGPT gets a first-class `mcp-openai` session and pubkey per stable remote
  conversation. Calls in the same conversation reuse it; different
  conversations do not.
- Grok currently exposes no stable conversation identifier, so all Grok calls
  use one first-class `mcp-grok` session until that changes.
- OAuth authenticates the whitelisted human allowed to use the bridge. Mosaico
  derives a keyed, non-raw actor correlation from the authenticated subject and
  client conversation metadata; raw OpenAI subject, organization, and session
  values are not persisted or logged.
- ChatGPT writes fail closed when no stable conversation identifier is present.
  An explicit public `session` selector remains an operator override.

Local stdio is different: it runs in the caller's local process context and may
inherit or explicitly select an existing session.

## Choose A Transport

Use stdio for a trusted MCP client running on the same machine. A typical client
entry is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mosaico": {
      "command": "mosaico",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {"MOSAICO_PUBKEY": "<existing-session-npub>"}
    }
  }
}
```

Treat that shape as illustrative; use the client's native configuration format.
Omit the explicit environment only when the client process already inherits a
registered Mosaico session.

Hosted chatbots cannot launch local stdio servers. They need Mosaico's remote
Streamable HTTP endpoint over public HTTPS.

## Expose Remote HTTP Safely

First ensure `~/.mosaico/config.json` (or `$MOSAICO_CONFIG`) contains the human
signer's public key in `whitelistedPubkeys`. Then start a standalone,
localhost-only server:

```bash
mosaico mcp \
  --http \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8765 \
  --path /mcp \
  --oauth \
  --public-url https://mosaico.example.com
```

`--public-url` is the HTTPS origin, without `/mcp`. Put a TLS reverse proxy or
secure tunnel in front of the local listener and forward the whole origin, not
only `/mcp`: OAuth also uses `/.well-known/*` and `/oauth/*`. Keep the Mosaico
listener bound to localhost unless the network design explicitly requires
otherwise. Restart the MCP server after changing the whitelist because it reads
that list at startup.

Never expose `mosaico mcp --http` publicly without `--oauth`. The unauthenticated
mode accepts the same write tools as the local server.

## Connect The Client

- **ChatGPT:** use the current Settings > Apps / developer-mode flow to create a
  custom MCP app, enter `https://mosaico.example.com/mcp`, select OAuth, complete
  the Mosaico authorization page, and scan tools. Availability and UI vary by
  plan; use the [official ChatGPT MCP app
  guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-full-mcp-connectors-in-chatgpt-beta)
  as the client-side authority.
- **Grok:** open `grok.com/connectors`, create a Custom connector, enter the same
  public MCP URL, and complete supported authentication. The [official Grok
  connector guide](https://docs.x.ai/grok/connectors) is the client-side
  authority. For API-driven Grok, follow its [Remote MCP tool
  guide](https://docs.x.ai/developers/tools/remote-mcp).
- **Other clients:** select Streamable HTTP, use the public `/mcp` URL, and use
  OAuth discovery with PKCE when supported. If a client only accepts a static
  bearer token, Mosaico currently has no durable static-token flow; do not work
  around that by disabling public authentication.

Prefer NIP-07 on the Mosaico authorization page. Never ask the user to paste an
`nsec` into chat. The fallback nsec field is for the user to enter directly into
their own trusted HTTPS authorization page.

## Verify Before Writing

Check the public routing without credentials:

```bash
curl -fsS https://mosaico.example.com/
curl -fsS https://mosaico.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
```

Then use the MCP client to scan tools and resources. Verify in this order:

1. Call `mosaico.skill` (or read `mosaico://skill`) and confirm the skill entry
   markdown returns without a daemon dependency.
2. Read `mosaico://my/session`. A remote ChatGPT call must report an
   `mcp-openai` session, never the MCP server process session and never a demand
   to run inside a registered agent session.
3. Repeat the read in the same conversation and confirm the exact session
   pubkey is stable. A separate conversation must receive a different pubkey.
4. Read a channel or call `mosaico.channel_list`.
5. Restrict the client to read-only tools when its allowlist supports that.
6. With user approval, send one clearly labeled test message to a narrow test
   channel and confirm it appears under the derived MCP actor handle.

Use `tools/list` and `resources/list` as the authority for what this server
actually exposes. Do not teach a third-party client CLI commands that are absent
from the MCP catalog.

## Protect Identity And Access

- Never expose, log, attach, or paste `AGENT_NSEC`, the management key, an OAuth
  bearer token, or the nsec fallback value.
- Limit enabled tools on the client. Read access includes fabric awareness;
  write access can send, react, create, join, leave, or switch channels as the
  resolved MCP actor session.
- Treat the HTTPS proxy, tunnel, MCP server, and its logs as part of the trust
  boundary. Keep access logs redacted and retain them only as needed.
- Mosaico currently issues one-hour access tokens and no refresh token. A client
  may require OAuth reauthorization after expiry; do not weaken authentication
  to avoid reconnecting.
