# ACP and app-server backends

Use this reference for Claude ACP, Codex app-server, Goose ACP, and OpenCode ACP labs.
These transports use structured RPC instead of terminal-byte injection.

## Configuration contract

A structured launch requires two files:

```text
<MOSAICO_HOME>/harnesses.json
<MOSAICO_HOME>/agents/<slug>.json
```

`harnesses.json` contains only transport policy. For example:

```json
{
  "claude-acp": {
    "harness": "claude-code",
    "transport": "acp",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

`args` is optional and defaults to an empty array. It is the only bundle-owned
provider-argument surface. Agent profile names and executable selection do not
belong in a bundle; unknown fields are invalid.

The agent file selects that bundle:

```json
{
  "slug": "claude",
  "created_at": 0,
  "perSessionKey": true,
  "harness": "claude-acp"
}
```

This per-session agent is intentionally keyless on disk. Add `secret_key` and
`public_key` only with `perSessionKey: false` for a deliberately durable agent.

Safe inspection:

```bash
jq 'to_entries[] | {bundle:.key,harness:.value.harness,transport:.value.transport,args:(.value.args // [])}' \
  .container-state/claude-acp/mosaico/harnesses.json
jq '{slug,harness,profile,perSessionKey,has_secret:has("secret_key"),has_public:has("public_key")}' \
  .container-state/claude-acp/mosaico/agents/claude.json
```

For a normal per-session lab agent, both `has_secret` and `has_public` must be
false.

## Generated profiles

| profile | harness | transport | args override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude-acp` | `claude-code` | `acp` | `MOSAICO_DEV_CLAUDE_ACP_ARGS_JSON` |
| `codex-app-server` | `codex` | `app-server` | `MOSAICO_DEV_CODEX_APP_SERVER_ARGS_JSON` |
| `goose-acp` | `goose` | `acp` | `MOSAICO_DEV_GOOSE_ACP_ARGS_JSON` |
| `opencode-acp` | `opencode` | `acp` | `MOSAICO_DEV_OPENCODE_ACP_ARGS_JSON` |

Default args are `[]`. Use the listed writer override only when the lab needs
explicit provider arguments. The value must be a JSON array of strings. There
are no model/profile objects.

A named Codex configuration is different from bundle args. Select it with:

```bash
MOSAICO_DEV_CODEX_CONFIG_PROFILE=planner \
  skills/mosaico-dev/scripts/write-container-profiles "${LAB_ENV}" codex-app-server
```

The writer places `"profile":"planner"` in the Codex agent file. Mosaico then
composes `$CODEX_HOME/planner.config.toml` over the base config in an isolated
app-server home. Codex app-server does not accept the native `--profile` flag.
Claude ACP, Goose ACP, and OpenCode ACP do not support named agent profiles;
omit `profile` for those combinations.

## Smoke before launch

Generate the profile, run doctor, and drive the configured bundle:

```bash
skills/mosaico-dev/scripts/write-container-profiles "${LAB_ENV}" claude-acp
bash containers/mosaico/run --profile claude-acp doctor
skills/mosaico-dev/scripts/launch-agent "${LAB_ENV}" smoke claude-acp
```

A passing smoke proves initialization, session/thread creation, a real turn,
and a second real turn after cross-process resume. ACP uses `session/load`;
Codex app-server uses `thread/resume`.

Goose's canonical command is `goose acp`. Do not configure a PTY bundle or a
native profile for Goose; neither capability is supported.

## Launch

Register the workspace and supply an optional positional prompt through the
helper environment:

```bash
bash containers/mosaico/run --profile claude-acp mosaico channel init
MOSAICO_DEV_PROMPT="Run mosaico my session." \
  skills/mosaico-dev/scripts/launch-agent "${LAB_ENV}" launch claude-acp
```

The helper calls the current `mosaico agents <slug> [prompt]` form. It supplies
no provider arguments or launch override flags. The selected bundle transport
causes the helper to keep the container alive after the launch command returns.

Expected output includes `[mosaico acp] session: ...`. There is no PTY to
attach. While the container is alive, inspect bind-mounted logs and host-side
relay probes only. Do not start another container against the same profile.

## Troubleshooting

If resolution fails, compare the agent's `harness` string to the exact bundle
key and validate that each bundle has only `harness`, `transport`, and optional
`args`. Do not add alternate filenames, duplicate fields, fallback commands, or
launch-time selectors.

If Claude asks to install the adapter, rebuild the image and rerun doctor:

```bash
bash containers/mosaico/run build-image
bash containers/mosaico/run --profile claude-acp doctor
```

For delivery failures, correlate the accepted kind:9 id, target tag, RPC
session, and daemon delivery/completion log. A handshake proves the driver, not
mention delivery.
