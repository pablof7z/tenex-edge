# Tenex-Edge Configuration

## Project Slug

The hostname value in the `@` suffix is sourced from the `backendName` field in the project's `.tenex/config.json` file. Project slug is resolved from `.tenex/project.json` if present, otherwise the git repo name (shared across worktrees), otherwise the basename of `$PWD`.

## Global Configuration

Whitelisted pubkeys come from `~/.tenex/config.json` field `whitelistedPubkeys` and relay is configured in the same file.

The `@opencode-ai/plugin` dependency version must match the installed opencode version (1.16.2) in both `~/.config/opencode/package.json` and `~/.opencode/package.json`. The opencode binary is located at `~/.opencode/bin/opencode`. <!-- [^96aed-2] -->

## Relay Authentication

Relay NIP-42 AUTH must be built into the transport layer from day one, as publishes fail silently without it. <!-- [^f3a73-21] -->

## Plugin Source Files

The canonical source for the tenex-edge opencode plugin is `~/src/tenex-edge/integrations/opencode/tenex-edge.ts`. The plugin code files are located at `~/.config/opencode/plugin/tenex-edge.ts` and `~/.config/opencode/plugin/proactive-context.ts`. <!-- [^96aed-3] -->

## Plugin SDK Compatibility

The plugin code's use of `info.role`, `info.id`, and `info.sessionID` is compatible with the 1.16.2 plugin SDK without code changes. <!-- [^96aed-4] -->
