# Tenex-Edge NIP-29 Groups

## NIP-29 Group Ownership and Lifecycle

The singleton daemon maintains an open subscription for NIP-29 groups it owns at all times. When starting a session in a project that does not yet have a NIP-29 group, the daemon automatically creates the group. The ensure_group_and_membership step runs before spawn_session in rpc_session_start, creating the group if unowned and adding the agent if not a member. reconcile_sessions re-ensures ownership and membership for revived sessions across daemon restarts. The persistent subscription covers kinds 39000/39001/39002 scoped by #d for owned slugs, riding the existing long-lived subscription. handle_incoming caches kind 39002 member snapshots authoritatively. Two new database tables (owned_groups and group_members) are added via the single-writer with_store path. Cache writes to owned_groups and group_members are gated on actual relay acceptance of the publish (using publish_signed_checked), treating 'already exists' as success, to prevent cache poisoning from transient relay rejections. Creating a NIP-29 group (kind 9007) does not automatically enforce membership; a separate 9002 edit-metadata event with closed+public tags is required to lock the group. Owned NIP-29 groups use closed+public access control (closed for writes, public for reads) to prevent outsider writes while keeping reads open for the daemon's non-member connection. Peer agents from other operators are intentionally locked out of owned NIP-29 groups as an accepted tradeoff of the closed/managed model. The NIP-29 probe validates that the relay honors the client-chosen group id (equal to the project slug) as the d-tag. The live topology verification (Blocker 1: whether relay29 authorizes writes by event-author vs connection-AUTH-identity) is required before the design is fully verified, as nak serve does not enforce NIP-29. When initiating a session with a new agent, the daemon automatically adds that agent as a member to the project's NIP-29 group so the agent finds itself already added when publishing presence status. NIP-29 group membership events are signed using the userNsec key from .tenex/config.json. If userNsec is unset, the session still starts (best-effort fail-open), logging the issue and continuing rather than blocking the session. If the daemon connects to nip29.f7z.io for presence events, the NIP-29 relay will require a tenex-edge group to exist (via project edit) before accepting kind:30315 events, otherwise they will be rejected. NIP-29 group management functions (group_create, group_lock_closed, group_put_user) and 39000/39001/39002 group-state subscriptions are currently coupled into the Kind1Codec and should be refactored to be owned by the NIP-29 fabric provider rather than the event codec.
