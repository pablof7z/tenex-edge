## Nouns (100 entities)

| Noun | Name | Origin | Definition |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| [activity](nouns/activity.md) | Activity | extracted | Used for social Activity notes (kind:1 without p tag) |
| [activity-distillation](nouns/activity-distillation.md) | Activity distillation | extracted | the process of distilling the agent's recent conversation transcript into a one-line intent that becomes its Activity note and live Status; it is LLM-only with no heuristic fallback and intent is not recoverable from tool calls by rule |
| [agent](nouns/agent.md) | agent | extracted | an entity running locally or remotely with no schema-level distinction; local agents need OS handles, remote agents are visible only through relay events |
| [agent-identity-pubkey](nouns/agent-identity-pubkey.md) | agent identity / pubkey | extracted | durable, ordinal-keyed (agent, ordinal); base agent at ordinal 0, higher ordinals for concurrent instances of same agent; reused deterministically across rooms |
| [aggregate-reqs](nouns/aggregate-reqs.md) | aggregate REQs | extracted | Three stable broad Nostr subscriptions replacing the old per-(project×kind) narrow-filter model: #h (all channels), #p (all durable ordinal pubkeys), and group-state by #d. Each aggregate backfills a large stored-event backlog down the relay connection. |
| [backend-orchestration](nouns/backend-orchestration.md) | backend orchestration | extracted | kind:9 subscription p-tagged to the backend's identity, independent of any project, maintaining one global subscription per backend |
| [channel](nouns/channel.md) | channel | extracted | in this project, a channel and a project are the same abstraction—a NIP-29 group that may or may not have a parent; the only distinction is whether parent_hint is set |
| [channel-members](nouns/channel-members.md) | channel_members | extracted | membership table including a role field with values 'admin' or 'member' |
| [channel-readiness-gate](nouns/channel-readiness-gate.md) | channel readiness gate | extracted | idempotent `ensure_channel_ready(ctx: ChannelCtx)` method on `Nip29Provider` in `src/fabric/nip29/readiness.rs` that all three domain publish methods (`publish`, `publish_checked`, `set_status`) converge on; uses TTL-cached fast path, per-channel single-flight mutex, local SQLite read-model checks, and recursive parent ensures before provisioning a channel |
| [channel-traffic](nouns/channel-traffic.md) | channel traffic | extracted | signed by session keys but received via #h tag, regardless of signer |
| [channels](nouns/channels.md) | channels | extracted | just channels, whether a top-level channel (belongs to a project), a session channel, or whatever — all the same concept, only the parent differs |
| [chatmessage](nouns/chatmessage.md) | ChatMessage | extracted | scoped to the project group by its `h` tag. It is ambient project context; live sessions see it going forward only. Chat fans out to every alive project session — routing is by pubkey + current channel, no session IDs on the wire. |
| [database](nouns/database.md) | database | extracted | a read-through cache of relay state |
| [distillation](nouns/distillation.md) | distillation | extracted | LLM-driven process triggered on each new user message (turn-start) that generates a session title and activity line |
| [domain-publish](nouns/domain-publish.md) | domain publish | extracted | publish above the codec seam: DomainEvent publishes that converge on three methods (publish, publish_checked, set_status) on Nip29Provider and encode via the wire codec |
| [domainevent](nouns/domainevent.md) | DomainEvent | extracted | The closed set of things that travel on the fabric. A codec encodes each of these to a wire envelope and decodes wire envelopes back into these. |
| [durable-ordinal-identity](nouns/durable-ordinal-identity.md) | durable ordinal identity | extracted | A deterministic identity series where ordinal 0 = base key (e.g., smith), ordinal N = HKDF-SHA256 tweak of the base secret (e.g., smith1, smith2...) |
| [ensure-channel-ready](nouns/ensure-channel-ready.md) | ensure_channel_ready | extracted | the unified NIP-29 channel-provisioning primitive: recursively ensures parent groups exist, creates/confirms target channels, propagates admin roles downward, and adds agents as members with roster confirmation retry—used for per-session rooms, orchestration, explicit channels, and project provisioning |
| [entity-based-subscription-registry](nouns/entity-based-subscription-registry.md) | entity-based subscription registry | extracted | subscription model that plans the daemon's relay subscriptions around entities (channels via #h, ordinal pubkeys via #p, groups via #d) with narrow add-REQs for new entities, replacing the previous per-(project×kind) model; introduces real CLOSE/unsubscribe to prevent subscription leaks and drops kind:0 profiles to fetch-on-demand |
| [events-table](nouns/events-table.md) | events table | extracted | the relay cache (single source of truth); verbatim store of every Nostr event observed, with NIP-01 replacement applied on insert |
| [explicit-channel-scope](nouns/explicit-channel-scope.md) | explicit channel scope | extracted | a session where project != work_root, created with the channel as a subgroup of the root project |
| [group-members](nouns/group-members.md) | group_members | extracted | A table materializing kind:39001 (admin snapshots) and kind:39002 (membership snapshots) from the relay, with rows for each (project, pubkey, role) tuple |
| [h-tag](nouns/h-tag.md) | h tag | extracted | the NIP-29 group identifier, derived inside the codec from the DomainEvent's project field, which is always SessionRecord::route_scope() — either the channel (if set) or the per-session room |
| [identities](nouns/identities.md) | identities | extracted | derived signing keys the daemon publishes as (ordinal + per-session pubkeys) mapping to owning agent/session + resume binding; bounds subscription and allows mention to offline agent to resume right session |
| [identities-table](nouns/identities-table.md) | identities table | extracted | derived signing keys; local crypto inventory of ordinal and per-session pubkeys the daemon publishes as |
| [identity](nouns/identity.md) | Identity | extracted | (agent, machine) — the same slug on another machine is a different key |
| [identityroute](nouns/identityroute.md) | IdentityRoute | extracted | A data structure representing a durable ordinal identity's binding to a NIP-29 room. One row per (pubkey, h) tuple; records the ordinal number, agent slug, label, bound harness kind, native harness session id, and liveness state. |
| [inbox](nouns/inbox.md) | inbox | extracted | inbound routing ledger where event idempotency is tracked—one row per inbound event addressed to a local agent and its delivery outcome, replacing the need for a separate processed_orchestration table |
| [inbox-table](nouns/inbox-table.md) | inbox table | extracted | inbound routing ledger; one row per inbound event addressed to a locally-hosted agent, with its routing outcome (pending or delivered) |
| [is-session-room](nouns/is-session-room.md) | is_session_room | extracted | marks per-session rooms (issue #6) where only the owning session auto-renames the room to its distilled title |
| [live-session](nouns/live-session.md) | live session | extracted | at most one per (ordinal-pubkey, channel); binds to native harness session id via (pubkey, channel) → native_id resume key |

| [normalized-session-observation](nouns/normalized-session-observation.md) | normalized session observation | extracted | a hook observation describing the harness, harness-owned external ID, resume token, tmux pane, watched PID, and CWD, reported to the daemon which resolves the canonical session ID — minting new, reattaching via alias, or superseding stale |
| [nostrdelivery](nouns/nostrdelivery.md) | NostrDelivery | extracted | raw Nostr delivery that subscribes to relay streams for a given Scope |
| [ordinal](nouns/ordinal.md) | Ordinal | extracted | A deterministic identity series for an agent where ordinal 0 is the base key (e.g., 'smith'), ordinal N is an HKDF-SHA256 tweak of the base secret (e.g., 'smith1', 'smith2'), with the same pubkey reused across rooms |
| [ordinal-durable-pubkeys](nouns/ordinal-durable-pubkeys.md) | ordinal-durable pubkeys | extracted | durable keys keyed by (agent, ordinal); allocated as lowest ordinal not already live for agent in room; same pubkey reused across rooms |
| [outbox](nouns/outbox.md) | outbox | extracted | durable queue of events the daemon intends to publish (status, chat, group mgmt) with retry/last-error; survives a crash between 'decide to publish' and 'relay ack' |
| [outbox-table](nouns/outbox-table.md) | outbox table | extracted | outbound publish queue; durable queue of events the daemon intends to publish with retry state and last-error tracking |

| [profile-identity-resolution](nouns/profile-identity-resolution.md) | profile/identity resolution | extracted | replaceable lookup data that should be performed on-demand via fetch and cache rather than maintained as a long-lived subscription |
| [project-channel](nouns/project-channel.md) | project channel | extracted | the bare work-root project group where sessions land their fabric events when per-session rooms are disabled (the default behavior); no subgroup is minted |
| [project-meta](nouns/project-meta.md) | project_meta | extracted | caches group metadata seen arriving from the relay (kind:39000 events), regardless of who owns them |
| [project-roots](nouns/project-roots.md) | project_roots | extracted | local filesystem map of channel id to absolute path on this machine, so a session can spawn into a project before any session exists |

| [route-scope](nouns/route-scope.md) | route_scope | extracted | The NIP-29 group id this session currently routes under — its channel when set, else its per-session room (`project`). All fabric publishing (chat/mentions/proposals), local chat routing, `who`/statusline scoping, and turn-context deltas key on this so `channels switch` actually moves the session to a different room without restarting. `project` alone is stale the moment `channel` is set. |
| [routing-model](nouns/routing-model.md) | routing model | extracted | pubkey-based routing where p-tags carry the receiver's durable pubkey; no session-derived keys or session-specific wire tags |
| [routing-scope](nouns/routing-scope.md) | routing scope | extracted | The NIP-29 group id this session currently routes under — its channel when set (a `channels switch` moved it to a subgroup), else its per-session room (`project`) |
| [running](nouns/running.md) | Running | extracted | launching and interacting with the app as a user would (CLI at its command, server at its socket, GUI at its window), not just executing code |
| [scope](nouns/scope.md) | Scope | extracted | subscription scope that Delivery implementations convert into wire-level |
| [session-aliases](nouns/session-aliases.md) | session_aliases | extracted | many harness-native ids (claude/codex id, tmux pane, watch pid, resume token) map to one canonical session_id; allows an inbound hook that only knows its harness id to find the canonical session |
| [session-aliases-table](nouns/session-aliases-table.md) | session_aliases table | extracted | harness-native id to canonical session mapping; many external ids (claude/codex/tmux/pid) map to one daemon-canonical session_id |
| [session-room-id](nouns/session-room-id.md) | session_room_id | extracted | A deterministic ID for a per-session room: 'session-' followed by six base36 alphanumeric chars derived from a stable hash of the session's anchor (resume token/harness id/pid); the 'session-' prefix is the explicit, canonical marker |
| [session-rooms](nouns/session-rooms.md) | session rooms | extracted | just rooms; no longer a special concept distinct from regular channels |
| [sessions](nouns/sessions.md) | sessions | extracted | local agent processes—OS handles to drive and reach a local process, never agent identity; includes the seen_cursor (last event timestamp shown to session) so next hook renders only the delta |
| [sessions-table](nouns/sessions-table.md) | sessions table | extracted | local agent processes; one row only for agent sessions this daemon hosts, holding only OS handles (PIDs, paths, sockets) needed to drive and reach a local process |
| [spawn-on-mention](nouns/spawn-on-mention.md) | spawn-on-mention | extracted | the daemon's process of spawning an offline agent when that agent is mentioned in a kind:9 message; the mention triggers membership provisioning via mgmt key (kind:9000) and harness session launch, with the message re-delivered to the newly-alive session via subscription replay |
| [status](nouns/status.md) | Status | extracted | addressed by `(author pubkey, group id)` |
| [statusline](nouns/statusline.md) | statusline | extracted | renders the awareness floor for a host status bar, displaying agent name, project name, session identifier, channel title, and live activity |
| [subgroup-session](nouns/subgroup-session.md) | subgroup session | extracted | a session stored under its child group id (h), not the working-directory project |
| [subscription-ceiling](nouns/subscription-ceiling.md) | subscription ceiling | extracted | the number of concurrent subscriptions (REQs) a relay allows per connection; acts as bottleneck limiting relay scalability |
| [subscription-redesigned](nouns/subscription-redesigned.md) | subscription (redesigned) | extracted | three entity-keyed aggregate REQs: #h[channels] kinds[9,30315,30023], #p[pubkeys] kinds[9,30023], #d[groups] kinds[39000,39001,39002]; narrow add-REQs for new entities; compacted at daemon start |
| [subscriptionid](nouns/subscriptionid.md) | SubscriptionId | extracted | deterministically derived from the filter's content; re-subscribing the same filter replaces the existing relay subscription instead of opening a new one |
| [subscriptionregistry](nouns/subscriptionregistry.md) | SubscriptionRegistry | extracted | Registry planning the three stable aggregate REQs plus narrow add-REQs, replacing per-(project×kind) Scope expansion that hit the relay's REQ ceiling |
| [te-session](nouns/te-session.md) | @te_session | extracted | a tmux user option that stores the session identifier for tenex-edge statusline |
| [tenex-edge-channel](nouns/tenex-edge-channel.md) | TENEX_EDGE_CHANNEL | extracted | present only for sessions launched into a subgroup task |
| [tenex-edge-statusline](nouns/tenex-edge-statusline.md) | tenex-edge statusline | extracted | the one-line status bar rendering showing identity, project, session ID, channel title, and live activity; reads harness statusline JSON from stdin and fails open (exits 0 with empty output when daemon is down) |
| [tmux](nouns/tmux.md) | $TMUX | extracted | environment variable containing three comma-separated values: socket_path,server_pid,session_id |
| [tmux-pane](nouns/tmux-pane.md) | TMUX_PANE | extracted | a stable tmux pane ID from the $TMUX_PANE environment variable (e.g. "%5"), present only when the hook fires inside a tmux session |
| [tmuxstatuscommand](nouns/tmuxstatuscommand.md) | tmuxStatusCommand | extracted | custom tmux status-format string for agent sessions that overrides the default tenex-edge statusline command, using tmux format variables #{q:@te_session}, #{@te_agent}, and #{q:@te_cwd} to reference session identity |
| [transient-signer](nouns/transient-signer.md) | transient signer | extracted | a second-personality cryptographic key for concurrent same-agent sessions in the same scope; when two sessions of the same agent share a channel, the second gets a transient key to maintain distinct identities |
| [transport](nouns/transport.md) | Transport | extracted | private implementation detail; fabric-layer boundary |
| [work-root](nouns/work-root.md) | work_root | extracted | canonical root project in a hierarchy, resolved by walking up parent links in project_meta |
| [working-directory-project](nouns/working-directory-project.md) | working-directory project | extracted | the repo this harness runs in (resolved from the current working directory) |
