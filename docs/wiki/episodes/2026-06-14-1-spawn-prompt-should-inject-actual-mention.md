# Episode: Spawn prompt should inject actual mention content, not generic default

## Prior State

Newly spawned tmux sessions receive SPAWN_PROMPT_DEFAULT ("tenex-edge inbox") injected via `tmux send-keys` after a 2-second delay, regardless of which mention triggered the spawn. The prompt is treated as a mere trigger to start a turn, not as meaningful content for the agent.

## Trigger

User observed the generic prompt and explicitly rejected it: when a session is spawned because an agent was p-tagged in a message, the injected prompt should contain the actual message content, not a meaningless generic command.

## Decision

The spawn prompt for mention-triggered sessions must convey the actual triggering message content rather than the opaque default. The `register_pending_spawn_with_mention` path already carries the mention data; it should drive the prompt text instead of falling back to `SPAWN_PROMPT_DEFAULT`.

## Consequences

- `SPAWN_PROMPT_DEFAULT` is a design flaw for the mention-triggered spawn path — it shows the agent a command with no semantic relevance to why it was started
- Reply threading via `mention_event_id` must be preserved in whatever prompt format replaces the default
- The turn-start inbox drain still delivers actual content; the prompt change is about what the agent sees typed into its input, not about the inbox delivery mechanism

## Open Tail

- Exact format of the mention-derived prompt (render the full envelope? just the body? a `tenex-edge inbox` plus context?)
- Whether `SPAWN_PROMPT_DEFAULT` remains as fallback for non-mention spawns (e.g. manual `tmux spawn`)
