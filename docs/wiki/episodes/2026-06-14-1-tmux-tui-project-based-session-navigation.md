# Episode: Tmux TUI project-based session navigation with tabs, filtering, and search

## Prior State

Tmux TUI showed sessions flat without project separation; users could not distinguish which project a session belonged to, and all projects were listed equally regardless of activity.

## Trigger

User requested project separation via tabs (line 1), then refined with three requirements: prioritize live projects, hide inactive (>7d) projects, add fuzzy search (lines 379-383).

## Decision

Sessions are now organized by project tabs (←/→ to switch). Tab ordering prioritizes projects with live sessions first (alphabetically), then recently active (within 7 days). Projects with no activity in the past 7 days are hidden from the tab bar entirely. Pressing '/' opens a fuzzy search overlay to find and jump to any project (including hidden ones). In the 'All' tab, sessions display as slug@project for disambiguation. Label renames: 'Spawnable (no session)' → 'Agents', '[spawnable via claude]' → '[claude]'.

## Consequences

- Stale/inactive projects no longer clutter the tab bar by default
- Hidden projects can still be reached via '/' search and are temporarily injected into visible tabs when selected
- Hidden projects re-hide on next periodic refresh unless activity resumes
- Agents section appears across all project tabs since agents are cross-project
