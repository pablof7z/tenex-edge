# Episode: Mgmt/backend exchanges filtered from agent-visible channel reads

## Prior State

Management commands (e.g. `list agents`) and their replies were published as ordinary kind:9 chat events to the relay and mirrored into local SQLite. No access-control or visibility filtering existed — any agent reading the channel via `chat_read` would see mgmt round-trips between the user and the daemon backend.

## Trigger

User observed that `tenex-edge channel read` showed a communication between the user and the mgmt agent, which was supposed to be invisible to agents.

## Decision

`handle_chat_read` now filters out backend-authored and backend-p-tagged rows (both in the initial batch and the `--live` tail), reusing the existing `is_backend_traffic` check from `fabric_context::messages` (bumped to `pub(crate)`). Mgmt round-trips no longer appear in agent channel reads.

## Consequences

- Agents reading a channel no longer see management command/reply exchanges, preserving the intended privacy of mgmt operations.
- The same backend-traffic predicate now guards both the hook/awareness snapshot path and the direct `chat_read` RPC path — consistent visibility invariant.

## Open Tail
