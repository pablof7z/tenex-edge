# Episode: Reply-instruction reminder added to mention injection paths

## Prior State

Both mention injection paths (hook-only fabric context rendering and pty-wrapped injection) deliberately included no reply hint. The doc comment in injection.rs explicitly stated 'No reply hint, no message id — the reply auto-publishes', because replies were expected to be auto-captured by the publish_agent_reply flow.

## Trigger

User directive: 'when we bring in a mention into an agent's attention (whether via hook or via pty-wrapped injection), let's explicitly add an instruction reminding the agent to respond via tenex-edge chat write.' This is also a consequence of removing auto-publish — without auto-publish, agents need to know how to reply explicitly.

## Decision

Add an explicit reply-instruction reminder (referencing 'tenex-edge chat write') to both mention injection paths: the hook-only path in render.rs (render_messages, around the [MENTIONS YOU] marker at line 146-147) and the pty-wrapped path in injection.rs (render_pty_mention, around lines 56-65).

## Consequences

- render_messages in fabric_context/render.rs must append a reply hint near the [MENTIONS YOU] flag
- render_pty_mention in injection.rs must append a reply instruction to the joined output
- The canonical command name is 'tenex-edge chat write' (confirmed by existing usage in who/render.rs and channel_membership_rpc.rs)
- The doc comment in injection.rs stating 'No reply hint' must be updated to reflect the new behavior

## Open Tail

- Exact wording and placement of the reply hint in each path
- Whether the hint should appear on every mention or only when the agent is expected to reply
