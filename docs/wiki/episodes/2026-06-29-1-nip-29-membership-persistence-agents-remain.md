# Episode: NIP-29 membership persistence: agents remain in channels across sessions

## Prior State

Agents were removed from channels via NIP-29 nip29_remove_member on session_end. Channel membership was ephemeral (session-bound).

## Trigger

User directive at line 78: 'it shouldn't remove it on session end'. Rationale: NIP-29 membership should represent durable channel membership, not ephemeral session state.

## Decision

Remove nip29_remove_member call from session_end handler. Adopt persistent membership model: agents stay as channel members across session boundaries; kind:30315 TTL is the sole liveness signal.

## Consequences

- Agents persist as channel members when sessions end, not evicted
- Offline/dead agents continue receiving messages sent to their channels
- Resumed agents are already members; no NIP-29 re-add on session restart
- Ordinal reuse path (issue #47) operates without membership churn
