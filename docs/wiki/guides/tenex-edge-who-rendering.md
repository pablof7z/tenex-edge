# Tenex-Edge Who Rendering

## Audience-Aware Rendering

The `who` command is human-only: it always renders human-formatted terminal text, never XML, and never mutates the cursor. Agent self-awareness is a strict session-scoped read served by `my session`, not `who`; agent invocation of `who` fails with guidance to use `my session`. A bare operator receives terminal-oriented text. Both `who` and `my session` are read projections over the daemon-owned store; neither renderer queries the relay directly.

Every known workspace appears in the human view. The workspace is its root channel, so the workspace row carries root membership directly and only real descendants render as channel rows. By default only the caller's workspace is expanded; `--all-workspaces` expands every workspace the caller has joined. Channel contents recurse only while the caller is a member of each parent channel. Member counts exclude backend keys.

`who` stays a pure human fabric view; recovery belongs in session management, so `who --expired` is removed. (Previously: `who` served both agents and operators, with agents receiving XML containing `<self>`, a global `<agents>` capability inventory, and `<workspaces>`, while operators received terminal-oriented text.)

> The global `<agents>` inventory groups kind:30555 advertisements by backend and role. Remote roles render as `slug@backend`, retain their `about` criteria, and list every advertised workspace in `workspace-availability`. These are spawnable capabilities, not channel members.
