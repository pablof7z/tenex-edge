# Tenex-Edge Who Rendering

## Audience-Aware Rendering

An exact live agent session receives XML with `<self>`, a global `<agents>` capability inventory, and `<workspaces>`. A bare operator receives terminal-oriented text. Both are read projections over the daemon-owned store; neither renderer queries the relay directly.

Every known workspace appears in agent XML. By default only the caller's workspace is expanded; `--all-workspaces` expands every workspace. Channel contents recurse only while the caller is a member of each parent channel. Compact channels expose `id`, `about`, and a member count that excludes backend keys.

## Capability Availability

The global `<agents>` inventory groups kind:30555 advertisements by backend and role. Remote roles render as `slug@backend`, retain their `about` criteria, and list every advertised workspace in `workspace-availability`. These are spawnable capabilities, not channel members.
