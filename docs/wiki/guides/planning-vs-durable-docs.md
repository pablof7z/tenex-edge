# Planning vs Durable Docs

## Plans Are Not Durable Documentation

Scattered notes, ad-hoc `TODO.md`, `NOTES.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `PLAN-foo.md` files, parallel planning docs, and inline `// TODO:` annotations used as a substitute for tracking are forbidden.

Plans are not durable understanding and must not survive as reference documentation after they have been implemented, executed, or invalidated. When a plan completes, it is removed or collapsed to the smallest live follow-up; lasting knowledge learned from the work belongs in durable documentation: `docs/product-spec/` for product doctrine, `docs/fabric-architecture*.md` and design docs under `docs/` for architecture, and `docs/wiki/` for source-backed synthesis. An implemented plan is no longer a source of truth; the issue is closed or the temporal detail is deleted, and durable lessons are preserved in the doc that owns that concept.

No new top-level planning files (`PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `NEXT.md`, `STATUS.md`) are created at the repo root or directly under `docs/`; new tactical detail belongs in a GitHub issue. State is not duplicated across files; a violation or feature tracked in GitHub Issues is not also restated in a separate plan file, maintaining a single source of truth per fact. When a doc is wrong, the authoritative document is edited in place rather than layering an appendix or revision section that contradicts the original while leaving the wrong text intact.

When in doubt, fewer planning files are preferred; if a new planning file feels necessary, the contributor must justify why it cannot be a GitHub issue plus a durable doc. The `Plans/` directory is empty and `M1.md` has been drained into `docs/daemon-design.md`, `docs/fabric-architecture.md`, and `docs/product-spec/`; no new files are added under `Plans/` or new top-level plan docs, as the canonical surfaces are GitHub Issues plus durable docs.

## TODO Comments

A `// TODO:` comment is not a plan. If it represents work to be done it belongs in a GitHub issue, and if it represents a known limitation or durable decision it belongs in the architecture/design doc or wiki article that owns the concept.

## Review Dumps and Post-Merge Notes

AI/codex review dumps and post-merge review notes must not be committed. Actionable findings are promoted into a GitHub issue or a durable doc, then the review is discarded.

## Plans Are Not Durable Documentation

Plans are not durable understanding and must not survive as reference documentation after they have been implemented, executed, or invalidated. When a plan completes, it is removed or collapsed to the smallest live follow-up; lasting knowledge learned from the work belongs in durable documentation instead.

## Docs and Wiki Artifacts Are Always Committed

Docs, wiki, and other documentation artifacts are always included in commits — never excluded, skipped, or treated as optional. Documentation changes ship with the code they describe. <!-- [^bd868-58e6d] -->
