# Tenex-Edge Daemon

## Lock File and Cleanup Behavior

Daemon `cleanup()` does not delete the lock file, so the flock persists on the same inode until the old daemon process exits. This prevents a two-daemon race over state.db. <!-- [^b07a5-50304] -->

## Command Surface and Output Modes

The `tenex-edge daemon` command is exposed as a visible subcommand with alias `__daemon` so the auto-spawner still works without modification. It runs in the foreground and produces colorized output on stdout while simultaneously writing the same output to a daemon.log file. When stdout is not a terminal (detached daemon), a single plain-text layer is used instead of dual ANSI-stdout plus file output. <!-- [^47f3c-0c97b] -->
