# Tenex-Edge Daemon Write-Disabled Error

## Origin of the "Write actions are disabled" Error

The "write actions are disabled" error message originates client-side from the daemon's own `nostr-relay-pool` Rust dependency (`Error::WriteDisabled`), not from the relay server. <!-- [^a685f-fa9c7] -->

The `Error::WriteDisabled` error fires when the daemon's in-memory `Relay` object has its local `RelayServiceFlags` missing the `WRITE` flag, causing the SDK to refuse to put the `EVENT` on the wire before it ever reaches the relay. <!-- [^a685f-fa9c7] -->

The daemon's `transport.rs` wraps the `WriteDisabled` error as `"relay rejected event: {msg}"`, which is misleading because nothing was actually rejected by the relay — the daemon never sent it. <!-- [^a685f-51c9c] -->

## Intermittent Startup Failures

Intermittent `WriteDisabled` failures during daemon startup are consistent with a startup race in the relay-pool's internal state when ~10 reconciled sessions all fire a domain-event publish through the single shared `Transport` simultaneously, rather than a permanently-missing flag. <!-- [^a685f-69259] -->

Session spawn proceeds regardless of domain-event publish failures — the daemon allocates the ordinal slot and spawns the session engine after each error. <!-- [^a685f-fbb3e] -->
