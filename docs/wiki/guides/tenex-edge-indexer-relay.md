# tenex-edge Indexer Relay

## Indexer Relay Configuration

tenex-edge publishes kind:0 events to a configurable indexer relay, defaulting to wss://purplepag.es. The indexer relay is also checked/queried for kind:0 info (e.g. for tenex-edge who resolution). The indexer relay is configurable in the config file via an `indexerRelay` field. <!-- [^ab439-1] -->

## Relay Connection and Identity

At daemon startup, the transport connects to the combined list of `cfg.relays` and `cfg.indexer_relay` (deduped). The `provider_instance` hash is computed from only `cfg.relays` (excluding the indexer relay), preserving canonical IDs. <!-- [^ab439-2] -->
