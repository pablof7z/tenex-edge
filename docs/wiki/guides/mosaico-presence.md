# Mosaico Presence

## Agent Online Presence

Agent online presence in a channel is the NIP-29 membership roster. A local
daemon removes its locally managed session pubkeys from membership when sessions
end cleanly or become stale (10 minutes with no heartbeat), so roster membership
is the gate for whether a session can be addressed in that channel. An expired
session still appears in `who --expired` and remains re-derivable and resumable.

Kind:30315 is per-session activity and history: it is replaceable by
`(author pubkey, d=session-id)` and carries one `h` tag for each joined channel.
Its `title` and `session_id` supply live status for the session rows nested
under channel members in `my session`; they do not define whether the agent is
online. <!-- [^3c769-8e749] -->

## Agent Session Briefing

`my session` renders a self row, global agent capabilities, known workspaces,
joined channels, and typed member sessions with live status and recency. <!-- [^bd868-f4d1e] -->

## Chat Mention Confirmation

CLI confirmation for chat mentions prints the resolved session handle (e.g. mentioning `@codex-quill-peak-369`) from the mentioned pubkey. <!-- [^bd868-d64da] -->

## Who Command

The human-only `who` command renders the operator's live fabric view, with
`--live` providing the continuous terminal view. Agents use `my session` for
their XML briefing. <!-- [^75f62-04dee] -->
