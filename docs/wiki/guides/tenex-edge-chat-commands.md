# tenex-edge Chat Commands

## Chat Commands

The CLI supports `tenex-edge chat write` to send chat messages in the NIP-29 codec and `tenex-edge chat read` with optional `--since <relative-time>`, `--limit`, `--offset`, `--tail`, and `--live` flags. When no read filters are provided, `chat read` defaults to showing the latest 10 messages. The `--live` flag keeps `chat read` open for streaming new messages. The `tenex-edge chat write` command requires the daemon to be running (via `tenex-edge __daemon`) before it can send messages, otherwise the command hangs indefinitely waiting for a socket connection at `~/.tenex/edge/daemon.sock`.

## Chat Write

Chat messages are published as NIP-C7 kind:9 events scoped to the NIP-29 project group with an `h` tag. The `--mention <session-id>` flag resolves session ids/codes, adds a `p` tag, and highlights that session while keeping the event as group chat. <!-- [^rollo-62] -->

## Chat Read Output

Chat read output format is `<$agentSlug@$hostName> message [timestamp]`. When ran by the user, `chat read` colorizes the sender label using deterministic colors based on the sender's pubkey. A standalone `chat read` from a user shell resolves its project scope from the current directory, with an optional hidden `--project` override for tests and cross-directory reads. <!-- [^rollo-63] -->

## Chat Delivery and Storage

Chat is delivered live-only; sessions created after a chat event are not backfilled and only receive messages going forward. Chat history is stored separately in a durable local log (`chat_messages`) from the live-only per-session hook delivery queue (`chat_inbox`). Agents see chat messages in a separate hook block from direct inbox; turn-start drains it and turn-check peeks it mid-turn. Explicit chat mentions via `--mention` ring the idle tmux doorbell; ambient chat waits for normal hook flow. <!-- [^rollo-64] -->
