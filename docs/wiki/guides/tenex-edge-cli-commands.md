# Tenex-Edge CLI Commands

## Installation

Install the CLI with `just install`, then run `tenex-edge install --all`. <!-- [^75f62-fdca2] -->

## Live View

The live view command is `who --live`. The old README's advertisement of a `tail` command is removed; `tail` is no longer part of the CLI, and a test asserts its absence. <!-- [^75f62-92209] -->

## Launch

The `tenex-edge launch` CLI command spawns an agent harness (e.g. claude, codex) inside a detached tmux session. <!-- [^abce9-05e58] -->

Agent launch configuration uses a `commands` array in `~/.tenex-edge/agents/<slug>.json`, with entries shaped as `{"name":"safe","argv":["claude"]}`. The old singular `command` field is not a compatibility fallback; files that only contain `command` behave as if no command is configured.

`tenex-edge launch <agent> --command-name <name>` selects one configured command non-interactively. `-c/--command <command>` overrides the whole launch argv for that invocation. When multiple commands exist and no name is passed, launch opens an interactive picker. When no commands exist, interactive launch offers suggestions from other agents' `commands` entries, then built-in harness defaults, and saves the selected command back as `commands`.
