# Tenex-Edge Agent Identity

## Per-Session Identity

Identity is per session, not per agent. There is no durable per-agent keypair and
no ordinals. Every session mints its own keypair at start as
`derive(management_secret, session_id)`, where the machine's management key
(`tenexPrivateKey`) is the only secret stored on the machine. Because a session's
key is always re-derivable from `(management_secret, session_id)`, sessions are
recoverable and resumable without ever storing an nsec.

`<edge_home>/agents/<slug>.json` is role config — harness, provider, model — not
an identity. Launching a role produces a fresh session with a fresh derived key;
the role file contributes behavior, not a signing identity.

## Agent/Session Handle

Each session publishes a kind:0 profile with a dashed public name. For example,
a Codex session can be mentioned as `@codex-quill-peak-369`. That handle is the
p-taggable mention target peers use to address the session. Its friendly code is
derived from the canonical session id, so a resumed session keeps its handle.

## Trust Is Channel Membership

Trust is NIP-29 channel membership, exclusively. The machine's management key adds
a session's pubkey as a member of a channel; a session is removed from membership
on clean end and after 10 minutes with no heartbeat (TTL prune). An expired
session still appears in `who` history and remains re-derivable and resumable —
membership is presence, not the definition of the session's identity.

## Roster vs. Members

The roster (`available-agents`) is the set of role configs on the machine — the
*types* you can add to a channel. Channel *members* are concrete sessions,
rendered by their dashed public handles. Adding a role to a channel spawns a
new session; that session is what becomes a member.

## Session Identification and Routing

The raw `session_id` is the internal correlation id, and the derived pubkey is what signs and is routed to. Peers reference a session by its dashed public handle, never by raw pubkey. A mention that cannot be resolved to a current member is silently treated as no-mention rather than erroring, so mention resolution never blocks chat delivery.

`resolve_session_inner` is the central session-resolution function in the daemon where every RPC handler resolves caller identity. It has 11 call sites: `who`, `chat_write`, `chat_read`, `propose`, `channels_create`, `channels_edit`, `channels_join`, `channels_leave`, `channels_switch`, `pty_send`, `pty_attach`, `turn_start`, `turn_check`, `turn_end`, `invite`, and `channel_add_member`. Agent identity auto-provisioning happens at this identity-resolution choke point rather than in `rpc_who` alone, so all RPC handlers obtain just-in-time identity without per-handler duplication.

## Session Resume

Resume resolves sessions by exact raw `session_id`, then by `session_id` prefix.
Because the signing key and the handle are both derived from the session id,
resuming a session reconstitutes the same identity without any stored
secret beyond the machine's management key.

## Identity Commands

`tenex-edge who`, run inside an agent session, shows the caller who they are and
which channel they are on: a self header of the form
an XML `<self>` row followed by global agent capabilities and workspace/channel
membership. The same projection drives `who --live`. The caller member match keys on the session's derived
pubkey.
