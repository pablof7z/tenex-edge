# Tenex-Edge Agent Identity

## Agent-Instance Identity

The local keystore entry at `~/.tenex-edge/agents/<slug>.json` is a derivation root for a capability, not an addressable base agent identity. Every running session is represented by a selected ordinal key derived from that root. The first live `haiku` session is `haiku1`; a second concurrent `haiku` in the same channel is `haiku2`. The same ordinal key may be reused concurrently in different channels, but never by two live sessions in the same channel.

Agent-instance identity is modeled as one first-class object carried from session birth through downstream consumers, so callsites do not recompute which pubkey signs or which label to display. `AgentInstance` carries the capability slug, derivation-root pubkey, selected ordinal, and selected ordinal pubkey. `EngineParams` carries the instance plus the derivation root keys through the engine spine. `Store::instance_identity_for_session()` and `DaemonState::session_instance(&Session)` project the bound identity row for read-side callers. Publishers, renderers, and routers consume this selected instance instead of reconstructing identity policy at edge sites.

Roster identity is separate from runtime session identity. Backend management keys publish kind:30555 capability roster events; those events advertise which base capability slugs a backend can provide to root channels. Runtime sessions still publish and sign presence/chat/profile events with their selected ordinal key.

`session_codename` generation is deleted entirely as a product concept. The codename apparatus (`session_codename(...)`, `resume_by_codename`, codename fields in hook/session-start JSON, and codename disambiguation in who renderers) has been removed. `SessionId` display renders the raw `session_id`; raw session ids are internal correlation handles, not agent names.

## Naming Conventions

Agent names use the format `agentName{ordinal}` starting at 1 (for example, `haiku1`). All displays use that ordinal label instead of codenames. Duplicate agent names never exist in the same channel, because ordinal instance labels disambiguate same-capability sessions. The ordinal instance label is the primary same-agent disambiguator on the wire.

## Session Identification

Local sessions are p-tagged by their ordinal agent-instance label (e.g., 'haiku1'), not by codename. Raw session_id is the only internal correlation id. SessionId's Display impl renders the raw session_id, not a codename. Codename generation is fully retired: SessionId display stops formatting as a codename, and raw session_id is used only internally.

## Identity Commands

The whoami command does not exist; instead, tenex-edge who shows the current agent who they are and what channel they are on when run inside an agent session context. The whoami CLI subcommand and its daemon dispatch are removed; its self-identity output is folded into the tenex-edge who command's agent-context output. When run by an agent, who displays a self header: 'You are **{label}** on **{channel}** ({host}).' followed by pubkey, status, member, and pending. The who self block carries label, pubkey, channel, host, is_member, working, status, pending, created_at, and a raw session_id — no codename field. The who self-header is prepended to both who output and who_live live fabric screens. The who fabric block's (you) member match keys on the selected ordinal pubkey via instance.pubkey rather than rec.agent_pubkey. The codename disambiguation apparatus in who renderers (display_row_agent_name, agent_name_counts_for_scope, agent_count_key) is deleted; concurrent same-agent instances render their ordinal slugs directly (e.g. haiku1/haiku2).

## Chat Mention Resolution

Chat mention extraction in extract_mentions accepts agent-slug-shaped tokens ([A-Za-z0-9._-]+, optionally @host-qualified). `@<agent-label>` targeting (e.g. @haiku / @haiku1) resolves to the selected instance pubkey. resolve_agent_pubkey resolves an agent-instance label (e.g. haiku1) to the ordinal-selected pubkey by reverse-looking-up relay_profiles by slug and host. Mention resolution never blocks chat delivery: an unresolvable mention token is silently treated as no-mention rather than erroring. The chat write CLI confirmation line displays 'mentioning @{label}' using the resolved agent label, falling back to plain 'sent chat {id}' when there is no mention.

## Session Resume

pty resume resolves sessions by exact raw session_id then session_id prefix only. resume_by_codename is deleted. The Resume CLI help text reads 'Session id (prefix) to resume.' The HookTail CLI help text reads 'Filter panes/events to a session id (or prefix)'. The codename field is dropped from session_start and hook JSON responses.

## Operator Surface and Logging

The TUI session row tag surfaces the raw session_id or agent-instance label. Tail session tags use the raw session_id for operator correlation. The slog per-session debug log filename uses the raw session_id. The session_label function in idref.rs renders 'agent@backend-label' (degrading to raw session_id only when slug is empty), not a codename. The hook echo-session-id response emits only {"session_id": canonical}; the codename field is dropped from session-start and hook JSON responses. Session-start hook responses and logs do not expose extra display aliases.

## Documentation Updates

The README, daemon-rpc-surface, and tail-v2-design docs reflect `@<agent-label>` targeting and raw session ids as internal correlation handles.

## Skill Reference

The `tenex-edge-identity-routing` skill teaches the current identity model: durable ordinal identities, `AgentInstance`, agent-label routing, and raw session IDs as internal-only handles. Product docs and wiki do not carry active `codename` or `whoami` vocabulary, except in historical transcript/citation evidence.
