# Tenex-Edge Proposals

## Proposal-Centric Inbox

The proposal (kind:30023) is a tool agents choose to use, not a system-enforced gate; there is no centrally-planned state machine. The product direction is proposals-primary with an optional drill-in to see inside projects/conversations — no version-chain or section-approval ceremony. Notes and approvals are plain natural-language kind:1 content with no structured machine-tags like 'approve' or 'proposal'; capable agents read the content and act. The user's review of a proposal is conveyed by the arrival of their plain kind:1 note — there is no separate 'reviewed' event type. A note on a proposal is an owner-signed kind:1 routed to the exact session that generated the proposal — reusing the targeted-session delivery mechanism. Capable agents should not be over-prescribed with structured instruction tags or protocol ceremony; plain natural language in the content is sufficient for them to understand and act. (Previously: The proposal becomes the only human-facing artifact with a state machine inbox.)

## M1 Substrate

The tenex-edge M1 substrate consists of two additions: tenex-edge propose (agent publishes a kind:30023 + canonical record) and inbound admission of owner-signed notes (accepting a human-nsec-signed kind:1 targeting a session). The note/transport path already exists via phone→relay→daemon subscription→session inbox.

`tenex-edge propose` publishes a kind:30023 long-form event signed by the agent's identity with routing tags (`d`, `title`, `h`=project, `session-id`, `p`=owner) and a canonical thread record. The command accepts `--title`, `--message`, `--thread` (for root event-id), and `--d` (for stable-id/revisions). The `--d` flag allows revising an existing proposal at the same naddr so updates supersede at the same address; omitting it mints a new one. The `--thread` argument becomes an NIP-10 `e` tag with relay and marker `root` linking the proposal to the originating conversation. It automatically stamps tags `h` (project), `p` (owner), and `session-id` on the published event. The `propose` command must never include an `agent` tag. The `propose` CLI command (which publishes kind:30023 long-form events) was accidentally dropped in the `98582fa` refactor enforcing code file size limits and must be restored.

The propose command works without an active session, falling back to the cwd for project and `TENEX_EDGE_AGENT`/`--agent` for the slug. When a live session is available, the propose command uses it to determine project and slug and stamps a `session-id` tag on the event; when no session is available, the `session-id` tag is omitted.

The remote-first loop is: agent publishes a kind:30023 proposal (owner-tagged) → phone sees it → phone publishes a plain owner-signed kind:1 note to the relay → daemon admits it via the ownership gate and delivers it to the exact session that authored the proposal.

The `propose` tool publishes kind:30023 events to configurable relays. The architecture report describing the system is itself published as a kind:30023 event via the `propose` tool it describes, dogfooding the tool onto relay.primal.net at a persistent naddr.

A real claude-haiku agent created a project and published a real kind:30023 proposal via the `propose` tool on the production fabric, and real Claude↔Codex review chatter flowed via kind:1 messages routed by membership with slug from kind:0.

## Product Direction Artifact

The 5-opus product brainstorm produced briefs stored in tenex-off/Plans/brainstorm/ (01-proposals, 02-voice-brief, 03-observability, 04-work-threads-team, 05-remote-audio) and a synthesis in tenex-off/Plans/product-direction.md, converging on proposals as the primary human-facing artifact with a lifecycle of drafting→proposed→annotated→executing. The product direction is synthesized into tenex-off/Plans/product-direction.md with locked decisions and an M1 spec.
