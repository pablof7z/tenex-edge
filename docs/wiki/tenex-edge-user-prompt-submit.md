# Tenex-Edge User Prompt Submit

## User Prompt Submit Hook

The UserPromptSubmit hook creates a kind:1 OP (root event with no e-tag) signed by the userNsec from ~/.tenex/config.json, published to the NIP-29 group via an h tag with the project slug, and p-tagging the agent pubkey that will process the message. The hook passes the prompt text directly to turn_start to be persisted as last_user_prompt, and the runtime seed prefers this captured prompt over the lagging transcript file. The hook fails open — if userNsec is absent, nsec is invalid, session is not found, or relay publish fails, the hook prints an error via eprintln and returns Ok(()) rather than blocking the editor. The cli.rs user-prompt-submit hook arm extracts the prompt field from stdin JSON, clones the session id so it can be passed to both turn_start and the user_prompt RPC, then calls user_prompt failing open. Claude Code's UserPromptSubmit hook stdout is plain text (no JSON wrapping required).

## Config Structure

The Config struct includes user_nsec: Option<String>, deserialized from the JSON key "userNsec" in ~/.tenex/config.json.

State storage includes a last_user_prompt column with corresponding set_ and get_ accessors for persisting the prompt at turn start. <!-- [^1b868-10] -->

## Daemon Handler & Event Semantics

The rpc_user_prompt daemon handler resolves the session to obtain agent_pubkey and project, parses userNsec from config, and uses it to sign kind:1 events when a user submits a prompt from the CLI. Both rpc_user_prompt and rpc_project_edit are gated on userNsec being set in ~/.tenex/config.json. The handler builds a kind:1 OP with h (project), p (agent_pubkey), and session-id tags, and publishes signed via the daemon's shared transport. The session-id tag scopes user prompt events to the intended session, preventing cross-session fan-out to all sessions of the agent. No 'agent' tag should ever exist on kind:1 events — the system must not read or write the ['agent', pubkey, slug] tag. After the event is published, suppress_inbox_event pre-inserts it as delivered=1 so that relay echoes of the user's own prompt never appear as unread inbox items. The user_prompt path fails open when userNsec is absent or the relay is unreachable, so the hook does not block the editor. Activity vs Mention disambiguation on kind:1 events uses the presence of a p tag: events with a p tag are Mentions; events without a p tag are Activity. Codec disambiguation for kind:1 events follows priority order: p-tag → Mention, e-tag with 'root' marker → TurnReply, neither → Activity. The sender slug is not carried on the wire in kind:1 events; it must be resolved from the profile store at routing time when from_slug is empty. fetch_mentions_into_inbox must use an operator-key check (not an agent tag) to skip user-prompt events authored by the operator. handle_incoming must gate Mention routing with the same owner-key check so that operator-authored echoes from the relay never enter the inbox. Thread e-tags follow NIP-10: root event gets ['e', root_id, '', 'root'] and reply marker gets ['e', reply_id, '', 'reply']. When an agent finishes producing text (stop hook), it publishes a kind:1 TurnReply with its own key, e-tagging the root event and the triggering user prompt event. TurnReply kind:1 events carry two e-tags: one with 'root' marker pointing to the first user prompt of the session, and one with 'reply' marker pointing to the user prompt that triggered the current turn. The first user prompt in a session is the thread root (no e-tags), the agent's first reply e-tags both root and reply to that same root event, and subsequent user prompts carry root and reply markers referencing prior messages. Subsequent user prompts after the root must include NIP-10 e-tags with a root marker pointing to the thread root event and a reply marker pointing to the last agent TurnReply event ID. The TurnReply event ID must be persisted after publishing so that subsequent user prompts can reference it as the reply e-tag. When an artifact such as a kind:30023 event is published, it must e-tag the root conversation event to link back to the originating conversation. The user_prompt RPC resolves the session to obtain agent_pubkey and project, parses userNsec from config, builds a kind:1 event with ["h", project] and ["p", agent_pubkey] tags (no e tag), and publishes signed via the daemon transport.
