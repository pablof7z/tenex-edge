# Tenex-Edge Session Management

## Session Start

The MVP (M1) launches a session via `tenex-edge inbox new-session --agent <agent-slug>`, replacing the removed `tenex-edge tmux spawn --agent` CLI subcommand (the underlying daemon RPC `tmux_spawn` and TUI spawn path remain intact). The command forks a background process, creates a session ID, and publishes a presence heartbeat (kind:24011) every 30 seconds with tags for whitelisted pubkeys, project slug, agent pubkey/slug, and session ID. (Previously: the presence heartbeat used kind:30315.) Presence is encoded as kind:30315 with d tag "tenex-edge-presence:<session-id>", content "online", and h tag for NIP-29 group scoping; Status uses the same kind but d tag = project. The agent publishes a kind:0 Profile event on startup before Presence and Status. The session-start hook emits JSON to stdout (not plain text), using `json.dumps({"systemMessage": msg})` to output the wait-for-mention instruction as valid JSON, because Codex parses the hook's stdout as JSON. The Codex SessionStart hook JSON schema includes an optional `systemMessage` field (injects a string into the session context), an optional `suppressOutput` boolean (suppresses the hook's output display), an optional `stopReason` string (can abort the session), and an optional `hookSpecificOutput` field (for session-start-specific extras conforming to `SessionStartHookSpecificOutputWire`). The hook injects an instruction telling the agent to run the `wait-for-mention` command itself (with `run_in_background=true` instead of shell `&`), rather than the hook running the command as a spawned background child. On the first turn (flagged by `/tmp/tenex-wfm-hinted-{sid}`), the hook prints a reminder to run `tenex-edge wait-for-mention` with `run_in_background=true`. The `wait-for-mention` command polls the SQLite inbox every ~500ms until a mention arrives, prints the mention, and exits 0. On startup, `wait-for-mention` performs a self-fetch from the relay (the same operation as `inbox`) to handle the engine warmup race. After printing a mention, `wait-for-mention` prints a reminder to re-run the command with `run_in_background=true` to receive the next mention. When a background command completes, an idle agent is woken by the harness. The `wait-for-mention` command has a default timeout of 5 minutes so that forgotten background processes do not linger forever. The background session process is bidirectional (not just a publisher), accumulating a local peer directory (slug-to-pubkey) and dropping inbound messages into an inbox from the NIP-29 project group. Mentions to the same pubkey (sibling session) are routed rather than self-skipped; presence and profile events still skip self. tenex-edge does not publish 24010 events; received 24011 presence events are ignored, not emitted. The live agent indicator in tenex tail is a DomainEvent::Presence using kind 30315, a NIP-38-style addressable heartbeat event keyed by d = tenex-edge-presence:<session> with an expiration tag. Sessions appear live only while the heartbeat keeps refreshing the 30315 event. A liveness reaper captures the parent process PID before daemonizing, polls `kill(pid,0)` each heartbeat tick, and self-terminates if the parent is gone; the reaper publishes an already-expired presence heartbeat and NIP-38 status gets a NIP-40 expiration tag plus an empty-status publish on death. tenex-edge runs as a per-session process, not a shared daemon. Stale sessions must not show as active; agents whose heartbeats have stopped must not appear as current peers. Inbound context injection into host sessions is in scope for M1. Session auto-resolution allows agents to run `tenex-edge who`, `inbox`, and `send-message` without specifying a session ID, resolving via the `$TENEX_EDGE_SESSION` environment variable (exported by launchers/plugins) or falling back to the current working directory's project. Achieving true idle-agent reactivity requires a harness-level wake mechanism such as ScheduleWakeup, `/loop`, or cron, not a blocking wait command. pc's awareness hooks and session-start are removed from Claude Code settings; tenex-edge drives session lifecycle and awareness, with pc reduced to inject + capture only. The UserPromptSubmit hook injects the available agent list (who output including what each agent is doing) into the agent's context each turn. Contextual blocks are printed as plain-text blocks joined by double newlines to stdout so the host injects them into the model's context before the turn begins. The CLI replaces the `observe` verb with `turn-start` and `turn-end` verbs. The `turn-start` command outputs nothing to stdout; it updates the SQLite turn_state table by setting working=1 and storing the timestamp and optional transcript path. The thread_root_event_id for a session is set on the first user prompt and never changes; last_prompt_event_id is updated on every user prompt. When a new turn is detected and the session has no title, the session title is immediately set to a titleized, truncated version of the user's last prompt; the `titleize_prompt` helper extracts the first non-empty line of a prompt, strips leading markdown/list characters, and truncates at 60 characters at a word boundary. The demo scripts accept either the globally configured agent slug or the demo-default slug to prevent assertion failures on machines with existing installs. The help descriptions for session-start and session-end are left as-is since they do not falsely imply the bare verb is host-facing, and session-start --agent <slug> remains a documented manual entry point. In headless opencode runs, the plugin's fire-and-forget session-start races with the single turn, so the session must be pre-registered via the hook for opencode to send messages. In the one-shot scenario where the sender's session has ended before the recipient comes online, tenex-edge inbox shows empty for an untargeted same-daemon mention to a since-restarted session, even though canonical delivery works — this untargeted/restart variant is flagged as a known gap. For claude-code and codex, tenex-edge adopts the harness's native session id as its own (the id stored in the sessions table is the resume token), which enables resuming sessions not originally spawned by tenex-edge tmux. A sonnet agent should be launched to verify opencode's resumption dynamics (specifically whether tenex-edge-generated ids round-trip through opencode's resume command). Creating a new session via the TUI does not send any default user message (the `SPAWN_PROMPT_DEFAULT = "tenex-edge inbox"` constant and its automatic injection ~2 seconds after startup are removed). Session resumption only works for sessions running on the current machine; resuming a remote machine's session is out of scope due to complexity.

## Agent Status

Agents keep a running NIP-38 status per project slug (kind:30315 d-tagging their project slug, empty when idle), h-tagged to the project group.

<!-- citations: [^f3a73-44] [^f3a73-123] -->
## Activity Streaming

`tenex-edge tail -f <optional-project-slug>` streams colorized activity to the console, with an optional project slug filter.

Agent activity is published as kind:1 events with NIP-29 `h` tags and `t` tags for the project slug.

## Discovering Peers

The `who` command shows agents whose heartbeat is still fresh (default 90 seconds = 3× the 30-second tick) and prunes stale peer rows older than 10 minutes each tick. It shows your own live agents (marked as `this machine`) merged with fresh foreign peers. Agents available for spawning (configured but idle, without live heartbeats) are also announced so they are visible without a session tag. The engine captures peers' NIP-38 status and stores its own; `who` renders the format: `agent@hostname [session $id] [$relativePwd]` on the first line, then `$currentStatus` on the next. Same-machine entries have no host annotation; different-host entries show `(remote)`. The relative working directory displayed is relative to the project root (not absolute $PWD), so worktrees render as `worktree1/worktree2` and the root shows as `.`. The peer_sessions table has a first_seen column populated on INSERT only, never on heartbeat updates, so it accurately marks when a peer appeared. `who --live` opens a full-screen terminal board that refreshes the same local awareness snapshot until q, Esc, or Ctrl-C exits; `--all --live` keeps stale sessions visible.

The `tail` command's presence event display uses the `slug@host` pattern instead of `slug@project`.

The cwd/working-directory field broadcast in status events must be the project-relative form (not absolute $HOME path) to avoid leaking filesystem paths on the public relay.

The `threads --project` command must print the full thread id (not a truncated short_id) so it can be passed back to `--thread`. <!-- [^ab999-73] -->

For multi-machine deployments, only one machine should spawn a given agent; a signal (such as owned_groups or agent config) must prevent both daemons from spawning the same agent on a mention.

## macOS Binary Reinstalls

Binary reinstalls on macOS require `xattr -cr` and `codesign --force --sign -` to prevent macOS SIGKILL on the fork/re-exec path. <!-- [^f3a73-78] -->

## Q1 Collision Logging

Q1 collision logging (agent, path, timestamp) starts on day one as passive logging within the substrate, to determine whether costly concurrent-agent collisions actually happen before building coordination mechanisms. <!-- [^f3a73-108] -->

## Session Resumption

A 'resume' action distinct from 'attach' is needed: attach reattaches to a still-living pane, while resume spawns a new process that reconstitutes the conversation from the native id. Each harness defines a resume spec on `SpawnDef` with a shape (`append-flag` vs `subcommand`) and a token (`--resume`, `--session`, `resume`), so the resume command is constructed by transforming the base launch command. The resume spawn path reuses the existing `spawn_agent` `new-window` flow with the transformed argv. The TUI/CLI offers 'resume' for local sessions whose tmux pane is dead, while offering 'attach' for sessions whose pane is still alive, using the `session_endpoints` table to determine pane liveness. Sessions store a `resume_id` field distinct from the identity `session_id`, because the `te-*` synthetic ID cannot be repurposed as opencode's resume token. For claude and codex, `resume_id` equals `session_id` (the adopted native UUID); for opencode, `resume_id` holds the forwarded `ses_*` native ID. The opencode plugin forwards its native `ses_*` session ID (read from `lastUser.info.sessionID`) to tenex-edge via the hook payload, enabling round-trip resumption. Sessions that were never spawned by tenex-edge tmux (e.g. started by hand in a terminal) are still resumable, because tenex-edge captures the native session ID via the SessionStart hook for harnesses that adopt the native ID.
