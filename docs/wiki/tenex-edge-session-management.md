# Tenex-Edge Session Management

## Session Start

The MVP (M1) launches a session via `tenex-edge session-start --agent <agent-slug>`, which forks a background process, publishes a presence heartbeat, and adopts the Claude Code session ID. The session-start hook emits JSON to stdout (not plain text), using `json.dumps({"systemMessage": msg})` to output the wait-for-mention instruction as valid JSON, because Codex parses the hook's stdout as JSON. The Codex SessionStart hook JSON schema includes an optional `systemMessage` field (injects a string into the session context), an optional `suppressOutput` boolean (suppresses the hook's output display), an optional `stopReason` string (can abort the session), and an optional `hookSpecificOutput` field (for session-start-specific extras conforming to `SessionStartHookSpecificOutputWire`). The hook injects an instruction telling the agent to run the `wait-for-mention` command itself (with `run_in_background=true` instead of shell `&`), rather than the hook running the command as a spawned background child. On the first turn (flagged by `/tmp/tenex-wfm-hinted-{sid}`), the hook prints a reminder to run `tenex-edge wait-for-mention` with `run_in_background=true`. The `wait-for-mention` command polls the SQLite inbox every ~500ms until a mention arrives, prints the mention, and exits 0. On startup, `wait-for-mention` performs a self-fetch from the relay (the same operation as `inbox`) to handle the engine warmup race. After printing a mention, `wait-for-mention` prints a reminder to re-run the command with `run_in_background=true` to receive the next mention. When a background command completes, an idle agent is woken by the harness. The `wait-for-mention` command has a default timeout of 5 minutes so that forgotten background processes do not linger forever. The background session process is bidirectional (not just a publisher), accumulating a local peer directory (slug-to-pubkey) and dropping inbound messages into an inbox from the NIP-29 project group. Mentions to the same pubkey (sibling session) are routed rather than self-skipped; presence and profile events still skip self. Presence is published every 30 seconds as expiring Nostr kind:30315 events with the author pubkey, p-tags for whitelisted pubkeys, an `h` tag for the project slug, a session-scoped `d` tag, an agent tag with pubkey and slug, and a session-id tag. The background process monitors whether the originating Claude Code session is still running and stops publishing if it dies. A liveness reaper captures the parent process PID before daemonizing, polls `kill(pid,0)` each heartbeat tick, and self-terminates if the parent is gone; the reaper publishes an already-expired presence heartbeat and NIP-38 status gets a NIP-40 expiration tag plus an empty-status publish on death. tenex-edge runs as a per-session process, not a shared daemon. Stale sessions must not show as active; agents whose heartbeats have stopped must not appear as current peers. Inbound context injection into host sessions is in scope for M1. Session auto-resolution allows agents to run `tenex-edge who`, `inbox`, and `send-message` without specifying a session ID, resolving via the `$TENEX_EDGE_SESSION` environment variable or the current working directory's project. Achieving true idle-agent reactivity requires a harness-level wake mechanism such as ScheduleWakeup, `/loop`, or cron, not a blocking wait command. pc's awareness hooks and session-start are removed from Claude Code settings; tenex-edge drives session lifecycle and awareness, with pc reduced to inject + capture only. The UserPromptSubmit hook injects the available agent list (who output including what each agent is doing) into the agent's context each turn. Contextual blocks are printed as plain-text blocks joined by double newlines to stdout so the host injects them into the model's context before the turn begins. The CLI replaces the `observe` verb with `turn-start` and `turn-end` verbs. The `turn-start` command outputs nothing to stdout; it updates the SQLite turn_state table by setting working=1 and storing the timestamp and optional transcript path. The demo scripts accept either the globally configured agent slug or the demo-default slug to prevent assertion failures on machines with existing installs.

## Agent Status

Agents keep a running NIP-38 status per project slug, h-tagged to the project group and set to empty when idle. <!-- [^f3a73-44] -->

## Activity Streaming

`tenex-edge tail -f <optional-project-slug>` streams colorized activity to the console, with an optional project slug filter.

Agent activity is published as kind:1 events with NIP-29 `h` tags for the project slug. <!-- [^f3a73-91] -->

## Discovering Peers

The `who` command shows agents whose heartbeat is still fresh (default 90 seconds = 3× the 30-second tick) and prunes stale peer rows older than 10 minutes each tick. It shows your own live agents (marked as `this machine`) merged with fresh foreign peers. The engine captures peers' NIP-38 status and stores its own; `who` renders slug@project with the activity status or 'idle'. `who --live` opens a full-screen terminal board that refreshes the same local awareness snapshot until q, Esc, or Ctrl-C exits; `--all --live` keeps stale sessions visible.

The `tail` command's presence event display uses the `slug@host` pattern instead of `slug@project`.

## macOS Binary Reinstalls

Binary reinstalls on macOS require `xattr -cr` and `codesign --force --sign -` to prevent macOS SIGKILL on the fork/re-exec path. <!-- [^f3a73-78] -->

## Q1 Collision Logging

Q1 collision logging (agent, path, timestamp) starts on day one as passive logging within the substrate, to determine whether costly concurrent-agent collisions actually happen before building coordination mechanisms. <!-- [^f3a73-108] -->
