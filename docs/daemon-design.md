# mosaico: per-machine daemon design

Status: implemented. Implements the architecture change
from **per-session process** to **one per-machine daemon** that solely owns
`state.db`, the relay connection, chat delivery, presence, NIP-29 membership cache,
and peer pruning.

## 1. Why

The earlier per-session process model let every agent session and CLI invocation
open its own `rusqlite` connection to `~/.mosaico/state.db`. Under about 16
concurrent writers this corrupted `state.db` in a real incident. The root cause
was multiple independent processes treating the same database as theirs to own,
alongside one relay connection per session.

The fix: collapse to **one daemon per machine** that is the sole owner of the
db and the (single) relay connection. Every CLI invocation and every
per-session engine becomes a **thin client** that talks to the daemon over a
Unix domain socket. One writer by construction → corruption window goes to
zero; N relay connections collapse to one.

This is a pure-internal change: **external CLI behavior and output are
preserved** (the Python hooks in `integrations/` and the parallel
Claude channel adapter shell out to these verbs and parse their stdout).

## 2. Stages (sequenced, each independently reviewable)

0. **Build/green baseline.** The implementation started from a green unit +
   local-relay integration baseline. Current test tiers are documented in the
   README: CI uses `just test-unit`; local relay integrations use `just test`;
   public-relay probes are ignored and run only by explicit command.
1. `src/state.rs` uses `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, and
   `busy_timeout=5000`.
2. The UDS daemon owns startup locking, socket reclamation, the version
   handshake, and one `Store`; CLI verbs are thin RPC clients.
3. Per-session engines run as daemon-owned async tasks over one shared
   `Transport`; `session_start` spawns an in-process `SessionTask`.

## 3. Process model

```

- The daemon is a normal `mosaico` invocation: `mosaico daemon`.
- The daemon runs the **tokio multi-thread runtime** (already how `main` builds
  it). It holds exactly one `Store` (single SQLite connection → one writer by
  construction) and one `Transport` (one relay connection).
- Per-session work runs as a tokio task inside the daemon (`SessionTask`), keyed
  by a private run key.

### Spawn-if-absent

Any invocation that needs state does `Daemon::connect_or_spawn()`:

1. Try to `connect()` to `$MOSAICO_HOME/daemon.sock` (default base
   `~/.mosaico`).
2. If that succeeds → return the client.
3. If it fails (no listener, or stale socket) → acquire the startup lock (§4),
   re-check (another racer may have just bound), and if still absent, **spawn**
   the daemon (double-fork / `setsid`, detach stdio → `~/.mosaico/daemon.log`),
   then poll-connect with a short timeout.

### Idle exit

The daemon **idle-exits** when no sessions are alive. It reuses the existing
liveness/heartbeat machinery:

- A session is "alive" when its `SessionTask` is running (it ends on `watch_pid`
  death, `session-end` RPC, or SIGTERM-equivalent intent).
- When the alive-session count drops to zero, start a **grace timer**
  (`MOSAICO_DAEMON_GRACE_S`, default 120s). If no new `session-start` /
  client connection arrives before it fires, the daemon shuts down cleanly
  (publishes offline presence for any lingering state, drops the socket,
  releases the lock).
- Any inbound client connection or `session-start` cancels the grace timer.

This keeps the daemon from outliving the fabric while avoiding flapping when
sessions briefly come and go.

## 4. Socket, lock, stale-reclaim, version handshake

Files (all under `$MOSAICO_HOME`, default `~/.mosaico`):

| file          | role                                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `daemon.sock` | the UDS the daemon binds; clients connect here              |
| `daemon.lock` | `flock`'d during startup to serialize racing spawners       |
| `daemon.log`  | detached daemon stdout+stderr                               |
| `state.db`    | the one SQLite db, owned solely by the daemon               |

### Race-safe startup

```
connect_or_spawn():
  if connect(sock) ok: return client
  lock = open("daemon.lock"); flock(lock, LOCK_EX)        # winner proceeds, losers wait
  if connect(sock) ok: unlock; return client              # someone bound while we waited
  if sock path exists:                                    # stale-socket case
      # a file is present but connect refused → previous daemon died uncleanly
      unlink(sock)                                         # safe: we hold the lock
  spawn_detached_daemon()                                  # binds sock under the same lock discipline
  unlock(lock)                                             # released AFTER spawn returns; daemon re-flocks on its own
  poll_connect(sock, deadline=~3s): return client
```

The **daemon** itself, on startup, also `flock`s `daemon.lock`, unlinks any
stale `daemon.sock`, binds, and only then begins serving — so even if two
daemons are spawned by a pathological race, only one can bind. The lock is held
by the daemon for its whole lifetime (advisory; cheap), which doubles as a
"is a daemon running" probe.

### Stale-socket case

Socket file exists but `connect()` is refused (ECONNREFUSED / ENOENT on the
peer) → the previous daemon crashed without cleaning up. Resolution: under the
lock, `unlink` the socket and reclaim. (Bind would otherwise fail with
EADDRINUSE.)

### Protocol version + version-skew handshake

The first line a client sends and the first line the daemon replies are a
**handshake** carrying a `protocol` integer:

```jsonc
// client → daemon, first frame
{"hello": {"protocol": 3, "client_version": "0.1.0"}}
// daemon → client, first frame
{"welcome": {"protocol": 3, "daemon_version": "0.1.0"}}
```

- `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is a `const u32` bumped on any breaking RPC change.
- **Newer client, older daemon** (binary upgraded under a running daemon — the
  human cutover): the client sees `welcome.protocol < its own` and sends a
  `{"please_exit": {"protocol": <new>}}` control frame. The old daemon, on
  seeing a request protocol it doesn't understand, replies
  `{"error": {"code": "protocol_skew", ...}}`, finishes draining, and exits
  (releasing the socket/lock). The client then loops back into
  `connect_or_spawn()`, which now spawns the **new** binary's daemon. Net: a
  newer client transparently re-execs the daemon to its own version rather than
  speaking a stale protocol.
- **Older client, newer daemon**: the client refuses (prints a clear "restart
  your session / reinstall" error). This is the rarer direction and not silently
  bridged.

Rationale: we never want a stale-protocol conversation to half-succeed. A
single version int + an exit-and-respawn handshake is the minimum that makes the
human cutover (drop a new binary in place, restart sessions) safe even while an
old daemon is live.

## 5. Wire protocol

Newline-delimited JSON over the UDS (one JSON object per line). Chosen over
length-prefixed for debuggability (`socat` / `nc` can talk to it) and because
all payloads are small. Each request is one line; each response is one or more
lines (see streaming, below) terminated by an `end` frame.

### Frame shapes

```jsonc
// request
{"id": 1, "method": "who", "params": { ... }}
// single response
{"id": 1, "ok": { ... }}
{"id": 1, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}
// streaming response (N frames then an end marker)
{"id": 1, "item": { ... }}
{"id": 1, "item": { ... }}
{"id": 1, "end": true}
```

`id` correlates responses to requests (allows pipelining; in practice each thin
CLI client issues one request and exits). The **streaming** shape (`item`* then
`end`) is built in from the start — `tail` needs server-push, and the
future `subscribe --json` verb the host adapters will want is the same
machinery. One-shot verbs simply emit a single `ok` and no `item`/`end`.

### Why the streaming framing matters (the key design call)

Walking each verb's true I/O shape:

| verb               | shape                | mechanism                                            |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `session_start`    | one-shot             | daemon spawns a `SessionTask`, returns its public `pubkey` |
| `session_end`      | one-shot             | daemon stops the `SessionTask`                       |
| `turn_start`       | one-shot (may be big)| daemon drains chat + builds context, returns text    |
| `turn_check`       | one-shot, read-only  | peek chat; no writes                                 |
| `turn_end`         | one-shot             | flip turn state                                      |
| `channel_send`       | one-shot             | daemon publishes kind:9 chat event on the relay      |
| `channel_read`        | one-shot             | daemon returns chat history for the session/project  |
| `who`              | one-shot             | snapshot rows                                        |
| `who --live`       | client-side poll     | client calls `who` each refresh; renders terminal    |
| `doctor`           | one-shot             | daemon does the relay round-trip, returns result     |
| `tail`             | **stream**           | daemon pushes decoded fabric events until disconnect |

`tail` forces the protocol beyond simple req/resp: the client cannot open its own relay
  subscription anymore (the daemon owns the single relay connection), so the
  daemon must stream decoded events to the client as they arrive, indefinitely,
  until the client disconnects (Ctrl-C). This is what makes the `item`*/`end`
  streaming shape mandatory rather than optional.

Client disconnect (EOF / broken pipe on the UDS) is the universal cancel signal:
it drops a `tail` subscription forwarder.

## 6. RPC surface

The full method catalog lives in [daemon-rpc-surface.md](daemon-rpc-surface.md). The daemon design here keeps the process, ownership, and lifecycle model.
## 7. Engine ownership inside the daemon

The `session_start` RPC makes the daemon spawn a tokio task running
`runtime::run_session`:

- It uses the daemon's **shared** `Store` through the ownership model in §8.
- It uses the daemon's **shared** `Transport`. The daemon maintains **one** relay
  connection and **one** union subscription (trusted authors ∪ all live session
  owners, per-project as needed). Incoming relay events are demuxed once,
  daemon-side, and routed to the right session chat queue(s). Mentions route via the
  `compute_targets` / `route_mention` logic over all alive sessions.
- Presence/status/activity publishing, heartbeats, turn-driven distillation, and
  `watch_pid` death detection all move into the per-session task, but publish
  through the shared `Transport`.
- Peer-staleness pruning is a single daemon-level periodic task.

`EngineParams` is reused largely as-is, minus `store_path` (the task gets the
shared store) and with the transport injected.

## 8. State ownership & the single-writer guarantee

The **single SQLite connection** lives in the daemon and is the sole writer by
construction — that is the whole point. Concurrency model inside the daemon:

- One `Store` behind the daemon's request loop. Two viable shapes:
  1. **`Arc<Mutex<Store>>`** shared by the request handlers and session tasks.
     Simple; rusqlite `Connection` is not `Sync` so a `Mutex` (or
     `tokio::sync::Mutex`) is required anyway. All db access is short.
  2. **DB actor task**: a single task owns the `Store`; everyone sends
     `oneshot`-replied commands over an `mpsc`. Cleaner serialization, no lock
     held across `.await`.

  Decision: start with **`std::sync::Mutex<Store>`** (lock only around the
  synchronous rusqlite calls, never across `.await`). It is the smallest change
  from today's code and already guarantees one writer. Revisit the actor shape
  only if lock contention shows up (unlikely at this call frequency).

- The relay `Transport` is shared (`Arc<Transport>`); its methods are already
  `&self` and internally synchronized by `nostr-sdk`.

Because there is exactly one process with exactly one connection, the
multi-writer corruption class is eliminated regardless of WAL (WAL stays as
defense-in-depth + a small perf win).

## 8a. Multi-agent on ONE connection (verified empirically)

The daemon hosts several agent identities at once (`claude@`, `codex@`,
`opencode@`, and sequential runtime incarnations of durable agents). Each
identity is one pubkey, with at most one active runtime. The whole premise of
the migration is **one relay connection** for all of them. Two facts had to hold
for that to be correct; both were probed against the live `relay.tenex.chat` (see
`tests/relay_probe.rs`; run explicitly with `MOSAICO_RELAY=<relay>` and `--ignored`):

1. **Cross-pubkey delivery.** A connection authenticated (NIP-42) as agent A
   *does* receive events p-tagged to a different agent B. The relay does **not**
   scope REQ delivery to the connection's authed identity. → A single shared
   subscription (union of all hosted pubkeys / projects) delivers every hosted
   agent's mentions. ✅ `one_authed_conn_receives_mentions_to_other_pubkeys`
2. **Multi-key publish.** An event **pre-signed by B** can be published over the
   A-authed connection (`client.send_event(&signed_by_b)`) and lands under B's
   authorship. → The daemon signs each outgoing event with the *originating
   agent's* `Keys` and sends it over the one connection. ✅
   `one_conn_publishes_events_signed_by_multiple_keys`

**Transport change required.** `Transport::connect` binds one `Keys` as the
connection signer (used for AUTH — fine, AUTH identity is irrelevant to
delivery per fact 1). But `publish_builder` signs with that one signer, which is
wrong for a multi-agent daemon. Add:

```rust
// sign with a specific agent's keys, publish over the shared connection
pub async fn publish_signed(&self, builder: EventBuilder, keys: &Keys) -> Result<EventId>;
```

The daemon picks the AUTH identity once (any one hosted agent key, or a stable
daemon key) and then `publish_signed`s each event with its true author. The
codec/wire output is unchanged.

## 8b. Demux + routing for multiple local agents (correctness)

Today `handle_incoming` / `route_mention` assume a single `me`. Inside the
daemon, "me" becomes the **set** of hosted local agent pubkeys:

- `is_self` = `local_pubkeys.contains(event.pubkey)` — skip our own
  profile/presence/activity/status for **any** hosted key.
- A `Mention` routes by `m.to_pubkey`: find the hosted identity whose pubkey
  equals `to_pubkey`, then deliver to that pubkey's active runtime if present
  (never another agent's runtime). Pending delivery remains owned by the pubkey
  across runtime replacement.
- Profile/presence/status from peers (non-local pubkeys) update the directory as
  today.

Test (added): a chat mention to A must land only in A's inbox, never B's; if A's
runtime is replaced before delivery, the replacement claims the same pending row.

## 8c. Session reconciliation on daemon (re)start (correctness)

The version-skew handshake (§4) and idle-exit can stop a daemon while session
rows are still `alive=1` in the db, and the new daemon's in-process
`SessionTask`s don't exist yet. On startup the daemon **reconciles**: for each
`alive=1` session row,

- `watch_pid` set and `pid_alive(watch_pid)` → respawn a `SessionTask` for it;
- else → remove that local agent pubkey from joined channel membership and
  `mark_session_dead`.

Without this, `who` and routing membership would lie after every daemon restart.
(Idle-exit only fires at zero alive sessions, so it doesn't orphan; the skew
re-exec can, hence reconciliation.)

## 8d. Clientful-but-sessionless connections vs idle-exit (§3)

The streaming `tail` RPC and `who --live` hold a client connection open
without owning a session. Decision: **an open client connection cancels the
idle-grace timer** (the daemon counts "live sessions + open client connections"
for liveness). So a lone tail-stream client keeps the daemon up; when it disconnects and no
sessions remain, the grace timer starts. This avoids live readers being silently
killed by an idle-exit mid-stream.

## 8e. Working directory in presence and awareness (implemented)

Agents may run in different working directories or git worktrees on the same
backend. Presence/status therefore carries `rel_cwd`, computed relative to the
workspace root, so peers can distinguish `worktree1` from `worktree2` without
publishing an absolute home-directory path. The materialized status row retains
that value for the human `who` view and the agent `my session` briefing.

- The wire tag is `["rel-cwd", <rel>]` and is omitted for an empty value.
- Workspace-root cwd is represented as `.`.
- If no workspace base resolves, publishing falls back to the cwd basename.
- `host` is the configured backend label, not a DNS hostname.
- `remote` is derived by comparing exact backend labels.

Human `who` renders terminal-oriented fabric text and supports `--live`.
Agent `my session` renders XML with self identity, capabilities, workspaces,
channels, and member sessions. There is no agent renderer or XML branch under
`who`.

## 9. Landmines preserved (must not regress)

- **rustls ring CryptoProvider** install in `main()` stays — the daemon is now
  the process that touches the relay, so the install must run on its path too
  (it already runs in `main` before dispatch; `daemon` goes through `main`).
- **Identical standard-Nostr wire output** — the codec seam
  (`fabric::nip29::wire`) is untouched; the daemon publishes the same builders.
- **Relay NIP-42 AUTH warm-up fetch** before any subscribe — `Transport::connect`
  already does the `kind:0 limit 1` warm-up; the daemon connects once and that
  warm-up runs once, before its union subscription.
- **NIP-29 membership semantics** — group creation, owner admin backfill, and
  agent member admission remain provider-owned and relay-authoritative. Local
  allow/block files are not part of the active NIP-29 path.

## 10. Tests

- **Daemon spawn race**: N threads call `connect_or_spawn()` simultaneously;
  assert exactly one daemon binds and all clients connect.
- **Stale-socket reclaim**: create a `daemon.sock` file with no listener; assert
  `connect_or_spawn()` unlinks + reclaims and connects.
- **RPC round-trip**: start a daemon (test home), issue `who` / `channel_send` /
  `channel_read` RPCs, assert results.
- **Version-skew handshake**: client with `protocol = N+1` against a daemon
  pinned to `N` → daemon exits, client respawns and succeeds; assert the old
  daemon process is gone.
- **Concurrency / corruption repro**: ~16 concurrent clients issue writes via
  the RPC path; assert a single writer (one daemon pid) and `PRAGMA
  integrity_check = ok` afterward. Keep a direct-`Store` stress test as the
  original-corruption regression repro so the thing we're fixing stays asserted.
- Keep the unit and local-relay integration suites green. Public-relay probes
  stay explicit because they publish disposable data to the configured relay.

## 11. Follow-ups (out of scope here, noted for the host adapters)

- `subscribe --json` streaming verb (same `item`*/`end` machinery as `tail`,
  but emitting structured JSON events instead of rendered lines) — the channel
  adapters will want it.
- Optional: a `daemon-status` / `doctor --daemon` verb to report daemon pid,
  uptime, alive-session count.
